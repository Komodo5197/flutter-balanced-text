A Flutter widget that simply balances the lines of two-line text, especially useful on long titles or short descriptions.

Does not differ from the `Text` widget if the text fits into a single line, or exceeds two lines.


## Usage

```dart
BalancedText('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog');
```

You can also pass properties like `style`, `maxLines`, `textAlign` etc.
